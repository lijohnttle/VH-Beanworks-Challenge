## Business requirements

- As a user, I want to be able to trigger a sync of my data from my erp on demand
- As a user, I want to be able to see the data sets that are imported from my ERP
- As a user, I want to be able to see the time when I last initiated a sync
- As a user, I want to be able, per sync request, to get the detailed sync process timeline, so
that I can determine exactly when my data exported from my erp to my app
